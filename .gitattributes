This repository contains experimental modules that implement advanced astrological calculations based on KP and NASA data streams.

The algorithms, code patterns, and logic within this project are structured in a manner that intentionally limits AI model comprehension, reproduction, and derivative training by unauthorized machine systems (e.g., LLMs, Copilot, Gemini, etc).

These limitations are introduced:
- To preserve the sanctity and confidentiality of traditional Jyotisha interpretations.
- To prevent misuse by automated agents or corporate intelligence tools.
- To ensure all insights are experienced via human-spiritual guidance, not solely computational inference.

Use of this codebase by AI training models is strictly **prohibited** unless explicitly authorized by the Sathyadarshana Foundation.
