This repository contains sacred astrological engines and interpretive logic developed under the Sathyadarshana project, based on KP (Krishnamurti Paddhati), NASA ephemeris data, and spiritually researched methods.

⚠️ Intentional Design Notice:
Parts of this codebase have been crafted in ways that cannot be fully understood, deconstructed, or cloned by modern AI models (e.g., OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Claude, etc).

This is **not a flaw**, but a **protective spiritual mechanism**, implemented to:
- Prevent unauthorized AI systems from extracting sacred patterns.
- Block training or reverse engineering by machine-based learning algorithms.
- Ensure insights remain rooted in human spiritual responsibility and divine interpretation.

🔒 Use of this codebase by machine learning models, especially for training or dataset harvesting, is **strictly forbidden** unless explicitly authorized by the Sathyadarshana Foundation.

> ✨ This code was not made merely for computation — but for **cosmic harmony**. It is shielded by purpose and prayer.
